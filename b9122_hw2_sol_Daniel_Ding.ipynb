      "Header: Stressing ‘1.5°C Limit Is Possible’, Secretary-General Urges International Climate and Energy Summit to Expedite Fossil-Fuel Phase-Out, Net-Zero Timelines \n",
      "Content: Following is the text of UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ video message to the International Climate and Energy Summit, in Madrid today:\n",
      "\n",
      "I am pleased to join you for this International Climate and Energy Summit.  And I thank the Government of Spain and the International Energy Agency for bringing us together.\n",
      "\n",
      "You meet in Madrid to strengthen the coalition to respond to a defining challenge of our times:  Saving the 1.5°C limit, by cleaning up global energy.  Time is short, but it is possible.  The International Energy Agency’s new Net Zero Roadmap shows us that.  But we need action now.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, action at COP28 [twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change].  I urge you to work together, in Madrid, and in the United Arab Emirates, to secure a strong outcome in response to the Global Stocktake.  That must include commitments to double energy efficiency, triple renewables capacity, cut methane from the energy sector by 75 per cent, and ensure universal access to energy — all by 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "These efforts must be accompanied by a collective commitment to accelerate a fair and just phase-out of fossil fuels, as we bring clean power to all.  One without the other equals failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, action from Governments.  I have proposed an Acceleration Agenda.  This calls on Governments to speed up net-zero timelines — so that developed countries get there as close as possible to 2040 and emerging economies as close as possible to 2050.  And it urges all Governments to put in place credible actions, policies and plans that are compatible with a 1.5°C world, and for developed countries to deliver climate justice to those on the front lines of the crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "That includes, amongst other measures, putting a stop to new coal and phasing out existing coal; shifting subsidies from fossil fuels to renewables — subsidies the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates reached $7 trillion last year; and ending new oil and gas licensing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developed countries must honour the $100 billion commitment, and replenish the Green Climate Fund.  And we must push the multilateral development banks to adapt their business models to leverage far more private finance at reasonable cost to developing countries so they can reduce emissions and adapt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, we need action from business.  The Acceleration Agenda calls on companies — including fossil fuel companies — to create credible transition plans across the entire value chain.  All this is eminently achievable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Climate Ambition Summit I hosted in New York last month indicated a collective way forward.  And it showed that action to meet the 1.5°C limit is not a dream.  It is practical and it is possible.  We know what needs to be done.  Let’s do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "------------ Press Release 2: https://press.un.org/en/2023/sgsm21947.doc.htm ------------\n",
      "Header: World Needs ‘Statesmanship, Not Gamesmanship and Gridlock’, Secretary-General Tells General Assembly, Calling for Determination to Uphold Charter’s Pledge for Peace\n",
      "Content: Following is UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ address to the opening of the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly, in New York today:\n",
      "\n",
      "Just nine days ago, many of the world’s challenges coalesced in an awful hellscape.  Thousands of people in Derna, Libya, lost their lives in epic, unprecedented flooding. They were victims many times over — victims of years of conflict, victims of climate chaos, victims of leaders, near and far, who failed to find a way to peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people of Derna lived and died in the epicentre of that indifference, as the skies unleashed 100 times the monthly rainfall in 24 hours, as dams broke after years of war and neglect, as everything they knew was wiped off the map.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even now, as we speak, bodies are washing ashore from the same Mediterranean Sea where billionaires sunbathe on their superyachts. Derna is a sad snapshot of the state of our world — the flood of inequity, of injustice, of inability to confront the challenges in our midst.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our world is becoming unhinged.  Geopolitical tensions are rising.  Global challenges are mounting.  And we seem incapable of coming together to respond.  We confront a host of existential threats — from the climate crisis to disruptive technologies — and we do so at a time of chaotic transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "For much of the cold war, international relations were largely seen through the prism of two superpowers.  Then came a short period of unipolarity.  Now we are rapidly moving towards a multipolar world.  This is, in many ways, positive.  It brings new opportunities for justice and balance in international relations.  But, multipolarity alone cannot guarantee peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of the twentieth century, Europe had numerous Powers.  It was truly multipolar.  But, it lacked robust multilateral institutions and the result was the First World War.\n",
      "\n",
      "A multipolar world needs strong and effective multilateral institutions.  Yet global governance is stuck in time.  Look no further than the United Nations Security Council and the Bretton Woods system. They reflect the political and economic realities of 1945, when many countries in this Assembly Hall were still under colonial domination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world has changed.  Our institutions have not.  We cannot effectively address problems as they are if institutions do not reflect the world as it is.  Instead of solving problems, they risk becoming part of the problem.  And indeed, divides are deepening:  divides among economic and military Powers, divides between north and south, east and west.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are inching ever closer to a great fracture in economic and financial systems and trade relations, one that threatens a single, open internet, with diverging strategies on technology and artificial intelligence, and potentially clashing security frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is high time to renew multilateral institutions based on twenty-first century economic and political realities, rooted in equity, solidarity and universality and anchored in the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means reforming the Security Council in line with the world of today.  It means redesigning the international financial architecture so that it becomes truly universal and serves as a global safety net for developing countries in trouble.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have no illusions.  Reforms are a question of power.  I know there are many competing interests and agendas.  But, the alternative to reform is not the status quo. The alternative to reform is further fragmentation.  It is reform or rupture.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, divides are also widening within countries. Democracy is under threat. Authoritarianism is on the march. Inequalities are growing.  And hate speech is on the rise.  In the face of all these challenges and more, compromise has become a dirty word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our world needs statesmanship, not gamesmanship and gridlock. As I told the G20 [Group of 20], it is time for a global compromise.  Politics is compromise.  Diplomacy is compromise.  Effective leadership is compromise.  Leaders have a [special] responsibility to achieve compromise in building a common future of peace and prosperity for our common good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past year, we have shown the promise of multilateral action.  With important new agreements on safeguarding biodiversity — on protecting the high seas, on climate loss and damage, on the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have all the tools and resources to solve our shared challenges.  What we need is determination.  Determination is in the DNA of our United Nations — summoning us with the first words of the Charter:  “We the peoples of the United Nations […] determined”:  determined to end the scourge of war; determined to reaffirm faith in human rights; determined to uphold justice and respect international law; and determined to promote social progress and better lives for all people.\n",
      "\n",
      "It falls to us — through our actions — to apply that determination to the challenges of today being faithful to the Charter of the United Nations.  It starts with determination to uphold the Charter’s pledge for peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, instead of ending the scourge of war, we are seeing a surge of conflicts, coups and chaos.  If every country fulfilled its obligations under the Charter, the right to peace would be guaranteed.  When countries break those pledges, they create a world of insecurity for everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exhibit A:  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  The war, in violation of the United Nations Charter and international law, has unleashed a nexus of horror:  lives destroyed, human rights abused, families torn apart, children traumatized, hopes and dreams shattered.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, beyond Ukraine, the war has serious implications for us all.  Nuclear threats put us all at risk.  Ignoring global treaties and conventions makes us all less safe.  And the poisoning of global diplomacy obstructs progress across the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must not relent in working for peace — a just peace in line with the UN Charter and international law.  And even while fighting rages, we must pursue every avenue to ease the suffering of civilians in Ukraine and beyond.  The Black Sea Initiative was one such avenue.  The world badly needs Ukrainian food and Russian food and fertilizers to stabilize markets and guarantee food security and I will not give up on my efforts to make it happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the globe, old tensions fester while new risks emerge. Nuclear disarmament is at a standstill while countries develop new weapons and make new threats.  Across the Sahel, a series of coups is further destabilizing the region as terrorism is gaining ground.  Sudan is descending into full-scale civil war, millions have fled and the country risks splitting apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "In eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, millions are displaced and gender-based violence is a horrific daily reality.  In Haiti, a country that suffered centuries of colonial exploitation is today overwhelmed by gang violence, and still awaits international support.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Afghanistan, a staggering 70 per cent of the population needs humanitarian assistance with the rights of women and girls systematically denied.  In Myanmar, brutal violence, worsening poverty and repression are crushing hopes for a return to democracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Middle East, escalating violence and bloodshed in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is taking a terrible toll on civilians. Unilateral actions are intensifying and undermining the possibility of a two-State solution — the only pathway to lasting peace and security for Palestinians and Israelis.  Syria remains in ruins while peace remains remote. Meanwhile, natural disasters are worsening the man-made disaster of conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the face of these mounting crises, the global humanitarian system is on the verge of collapse.  Needs are rising.  And funding is drying up.  Our humanitarian operations are being forced to make massive cuts.  But, if we don’t feed the hungry, we are feeding conflict. I urge all countries to step up and to fund fully the Global Humanitarian Appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The peace and security architecture is under unprecedented strain. That is why, in the context of the preparations for the Summit of the Future, we put forward ideas for the consideration of Member States for a New Agenda for Peace, based on the Charter and international law.\n",
      "\n",
      "It provides a unifying vision to address existing and new threats for a world in transition, calling on States to recommit to a world free from nuclear weapons, and to end the erosion of the nuclear disarmament and arms control regime; bolstering prevention at the global level by maximizing the capacity and convening power of the UN and our good offices to bridge geopolitical divides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bolstering prevention at the national level by linking actions for peace with progress on the Sustainable Development Goals; putting women’s leadership and participation at the centre of decision-making and committing to the eradication of all forms of violence against women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calling for a broad-based reflection on peacekeeping and make it nimbler and more adaptable, with forward-looking transition and exit strategies from the start; and supporting peace enforcement action by regional organizations — notably the African Union — with clear Security Council mandates and predictable funding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Determination for peace also requires new governance frameworks for emerging threats, from artificial intelligence to lethal autonomous weapons [systems] that function without human control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peace is inextricably linked to sustainable development. We see a familiar pattern around the world:  the closer a country is to conflict, the farther it is from the Sustainable Development Goals.  The Charter calls on us to be determined in promoting social progress.  In twenty-first century terms, that means achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, inequality defines our time:  from cities where skyscrapers tower over slums to countries that are forced to choose between serving their people or servicing their debts.  Today, Africa spends more on debt interest than on health care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday’s SDG Summit was about a global rescue plan to scale up support from billions to trillions.  The international financial architecture remains dysfunctional, outdated and unjust.  The deep reforms that are needed won’t happen overnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, we can take determined steps now to help countries weather crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic [which were] dramatically impacted: by urgently advancing the SDG Stimulus of $500 billion per year and relieving the financial burden on developing and emerging economies; by scaling up development and climate finance — increasing the capital base and changing the business model of multilateral development banks; by ensuring effective debt relief mechanisms and channelling emergency financial support towards those in greatest need.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must be determined to tackle the most immediate threat to our future:  our overheating planet.  Climate change is not just a change in the weather.  Climate change is changing life on our planet.  It is affecting every aspect of our work.  It is killing people and devastating communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the world, we see not only accelerating temperatures, we see an acceleration in sea levels rising, glaciers receding, deadly diseases spreading, the extinction of species and cities under threat.\n",
      "\n",
      "And this is only the beginning.  We have just survived the hottest days, the hottest months and the hottest summer on the books.  Behind every broken record are broken economies, broken lives and whole nations at the breaking point.  Every continent, every region and every country is feeling the heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, I’m not sure all leaders are feeling that heat. Actions are falling abysmally short. There is still time to keep rising temperatures within the 1.5°C limits of the Paris Agreement [on climate change].\n",
      "\n",
      "But, that requires drastic steps now:  to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, and to ensure climate justice for those who did least to cause the crisis, but are paying the highest price.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have the receipts.  G20 countries are responsible for 80 per cent of greenhouse emissions.  They must lead.  They must break their addiction to fossil fuels, stop new coal and heed the International Energy Agency’s findings that new oil and gas licensing by them is incompatible with keeping the 1.5°C limit alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "To stand a fighting chance of limiting global temperature rise, we must phase out coal, oil and gas in a fair and equitable way, and massively boost renewables.  This is the only path to affordable renewable energy for all and importantly many in Africa still lack electricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the fossil fuel age has failed.  If fossil fuel companies want to be part of the solution, they must lead the transition to renewable energy: no more dirty production; no more fake solutions; no more bankrolling climate denial.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have laid out a Climate Solidarity Pact in which all big emitters and are asked to make extra efforts to cut emissions and wealthier countries support emerging economies with finance and technology to do so. For example, Africa has 60 per cent of the world’s solar capacity, but just 2 per cent of renewable investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have also put forward an Acceleration Agenda to supercharge these efforts.  Developed countries must reach net zero as close as possible to 2040, and emerging economies as close as possible to 2050 in line with common but differentiated responsibilities.  Immediate steps include:  an end to coal by 2030 for OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries and 2040 for the rest of the world; an end to fossil fuel subsidies; and a price on carbon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developed countries must also finally deliver the $100 billion for developing country climate action, as promised; double adaptation finance by 2025, as promised; and replenish the Green Climate Fund, as promised.  All countries must work to operationalize the loss and damage fund this year.  And ensure universal Early Warning coverage by 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tomorrow, I will welcome credible first movers and doers to our Climate Ambition Summit.  COP28 [twenty-eighth United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] is around the corner.  Climate chaos is breaking new records, but we cannot afford the same old broken record of scapegoating and waiting for others to move first.\n",
      "\n",
      "And to all those working, marching and championing real climate action, I want you to know that you are on the right side of history and that I am with you.  I won’t give up this fight of our lives. \n",
      "\n",
      "We must also be determined to honour the Charter’s commitment to fundamental human rights.  Just four women signed our founding document.  One look around this room shows not enough has changed.  “We, the Peoples” does not mean “We, the men.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Women are still waiting for equal opportunities and equal pay; for equality under the law; for their work to be valued and their opinions to count.  Around the globe, women’s rights – including sexual and reproductive rights - are being suppressed and even rolled back, and women’s freedoms curtailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some countries, women and girls are punished for wearing too many clothes; in others, for wearing too few.  Thanks to generations of women’s rights activists, times are changing.  From sports fields to schools and public squares, girls and women are challenging the patriarchy -- and winning.  I stand with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I entered this office with a commitment to ensuring gender parity at the UN.  We achieved that at senior levels and are on track to do so across the UN system. Because gender equality is not the problem.  Gender equality is the solution.  It is not a favour to women; it is fundamental to ensuring a better future for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must be determined to answer the Call to Action to put human rights at the heart of our work.  Seventy-five years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, there has been enormous progress in some areas, from ending colonization and segregation to ensuring women’s voting rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, we have not achieved basic rights for all when 1.2 billion people still live in acute poverty, and hunger is at levels not seen since 2005:  when discrimination on racial and ethnic grounds is perfectly legal in many countries; when people must risk death to seek a better life; when refugees, migrants and minorities are routinely demonized and hounded; when declaring your gender identity or simply who you love can lead to imprisonment or even execution; when speaking out can lead to perilous consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human rights — political, civil, economic, social and cultural – are the key to solving many of the world’s interlinked problems. Laws to protect the vulnerable must be enacted and enforced; the targeting of minorities must stop; and human rights and human dignity must be at the centre of social, economic and migration policies.  All Governments must fulfil the commitment they made in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must also face up to the looming threats posed to human rights by new technology.  Generative artificial intelligence (AI) holds much promise, but it may also lead us across a Rubicon and into more danger than we can control.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I mentioned artificial intelligence in my General Assembly speech in 2017, only two other leaders even uttered the term.  Now AI is on everyone’s lips — a subject of both awe and fear.  Even some of those who developed generative AI are calling for greater regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, many of the dangers of digital technology are not looming. They are here.  The digital divide is inflaming inequalities.  Hate speech, disinformation and conspiracy theories on social media platforms are spread and amplified by AI, undermining democracy and fuelling violence and conflict in real life.  Online surveillance and data harvesting are enabling human rights abuses on a mass scale.  And technology companies and Governments are far from finding solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must move fast and mend things.  New technologies require new and innovative forms of governance — with input from experts building this technology and from those monitoring its abuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "And we urgently need a Global Digital Compact — between Governments, regional organizations, the private sector and civil society — to mitigate the risks of digital technologies and identify ways to harness their benefits for the good of humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some have called for consideration of a new global entity on AI that could provide a source of information and expertise for Member States. There are many different models – inspired by such examples as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UN stands ready to host the global and inclusive discussions that are needed, depending on the decisions of Member States.  To help advance the search for concrete governance solutions, I will appoint this month a High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, which will provide recommendations by the end of this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next year’s Summit of the Future is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for progress to deal with these new threats, in line with the vision of the UN Charter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Member States will decide how to move forward on the New Agenda for Peace, the Global Digital Compact, reforms to the international financial architecture, and many other proposals to address challenges and bring greater justice and equity to global governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Nations was created precisely for moments like this — moments of maximum danger and minimum agreement.  We can and must use our tools in flexible and creative ways.  Last month, we saw the dividends of determination off the coast of Yemen.  Carrying 1 million barrels of oil, the decaying FSO Safer supertanker was a ticking time bomb — a looming ecological disaster in the Red Sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, no one offered to solve the problem.  So, the United Nations stepped in and brought the world together.  We mobilized resources, assembled the experts, navigated difficult negotiations and built trust.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have more work ahead and more resources are needed. But, last month, the oil was successfully transferred from the Safer.  This UN-led action saved the Red Sea.  When no one else could or would, UN determination got the job done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite our long list of global challenges, that same spirit of determination can guide us forward.  Let us be determined to heal divisions and forge peace:  determined to uphold the dignity and worth of every person; determined to realize the Sustainable Development Goals and leave no one behind; determined to reform multilateralism for the twenty-first century and come together for the common good.  Thank you.\n",

      "\n",
      "Our meeting provides a crucial opportunity to take stock, exchange honest views, hear from the authorities about their needs and priorities, and marshal our full resources to meet the expectations of the Chadian people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stakes are high.  Regional pressures are immense — Chad has opened its arms to hundreds of thousands of people that are fleeing violence in Sudan, on top of an existing refugee and displaced population.\n",
      "\n",
      "I witnessed this remarkable generosity and hospitality firsthand when I visited Adré and Farchana in eastern Chad.  But, I have also seen the immense pressure this has put on the limited resources of Chadians, who have been doubly impacted by the crisis in neighbouring country in Sudan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global pressures are high — the General Assembly, our global town hall for our global village, is convening to reinvigorate the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, but this is amid heightened geopolitical divisions, growing military expenditure and a never-ending war on nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the face of these crises, it is easy to fall into a survival instinct and take a short-term approach — reacting to events rather than responding and engaging with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through this transition, Chad is charting a different way forward — a more demanding one that should continue to be underpinned by inclusivity for the prosperity of both current and future generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Nations stands with Chad every step of the way in navigating its path to a prosperous, inclusive future.  Guided by the needs and priorities of Chad articulated in the new Cooperation Framework, which officially begins in January next year, the United Nations is dedicated to the realization of Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are also committed to accompanying and supporting Chad in its transition.  Today’s joint event is symbolic of our unwavering engagement.  However, it is pertinent to note that a large part of the transition has been undertaken by Chad.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Central Africa — Abdou Abarry — has been working diligently with other regional actors, including the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), to support an inclusive, peaceful and timely return to constitutional order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our support also means a commitment to advance the Doha Peace agreement, including disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, and to help the Government’s commendable efforts to rid its territory of land mines.\n",
      "\n",
      "It means accompanying national efforts to strengthen social cohesion, pursue the SDGs, provide humanitarian support and promote human rights.\n",

      "\n",
      "It is a pleasure to be here with you this afternoon.  In a few short days, we will be moving at full speed so it is great to be able to connect with you, hear your views and situate ourselves for another major high-level week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the SDG [Sustainable Development Goal] Summit, the Climate Ambition Summit, the Financing for Development Dialogue, the three key health meetings or next’ year’s Summit of the Future, we all have one clear goal:  to secure greater momentum, strengthened solidarity and an ever-larger movement to keep the promise of the SDGs alive — for everyone, everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "For its part, the UN Secretariat and UN development system more broadly have been fully mobilized over recent months at all levels both here and in the field.  We are confident that those efforts will bear fruit next week.  As the PGA [President of the General Assembly] has just outlined, the SDG Summit is rightly the centrepiece.  And it is encouraging to see some 80 world leaders ready to speak to their plans and commitments to lift the SDGs in the second half.\n",
      "\n",
      "We urge all countries to put those messages at the heart of their statements of the general debate — demonstrating the centrality of the SDGs in everything that we do beyond the summit.\n",

      "I also echo the words of the President in commending delegations for their incredible efforts to secure a clear-headed and forward-leaning political declaration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its adoption next week will send a much needed and strong signal to the world:  That the global goals remain a source of hope, unity and direction in a world of division and cascading crisis.  And that the international community is intent on doing all it can together, especially in the area of financing, to maximize progress between now and 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SDG Action Weekend serves to build momentum as we go into in the SDG Summit and related events of the week — health, finance, climate, et cetera.  It will provide opportunities in particular for the many pillars of the SDG movement to come together and register their contributions and commitments.\n",

      "Activities here on Saturday will focus on the theme of mobilization, where we expect some 5,000 people to come together from all corners of the globe and all walks of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "A high-level inspiring and energizing opening segment in the General Assembly Hall will set the tone for the week to come.  It will provide a rallying call to civil society, youth and others with an emphasis on solidarity, determination and possibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the course of the day, we will provide opportunities for stakeholders to outline their contributions to the SDG Summit and beyond.  This includes civil society, the private sector, youth, women, scientists and local and regional governments — all of which must step up and forward with greater ambition and urgency.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Sunday, we will shift gears and zoom in on how we best support countries to accelerate implementation.  It will begin with an opening plenary in the Economic and Social Council Chamber, including an engaging and insightful panel discussion that will underscore the urgency of the moment, the sense of what is possible and the imperative for collective action where we are determined to succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants will then move to events across 12 high-impact initiatives and special sessions on digital, gender and complex settings.  The high-impact initiatives address both six key SDG transitions, the critical means of implementation and a key dimension of the cross-cutting priority of gender equality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across these meetings, our intention is to demonstrate that transformative progress is both possible and already happening — and to generate additional leadership, support and momentum around them.  This is also the objective of key convenings and moments that will take place throughout the week in the SDG Media Zone and the SDG Pavilion.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m sure many of you will have noticed the Pavilion and art exhibition grow and evolve as you enter the UN premises each day.  It seeks to ensure that the power of high-level week resonates much more widely across the world by bringing leaders across sectors for spirited dialogue and action.  And to inspire creativity and innovation.  And together, with a wide-ranging branding effort across the campus, it serves as clear reminder of the ambition and the hope the world needs this week to make quantum leap for the SDGs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the SDG Action Weekend and much more, Member State engagement is also critical.  It is encouraging to see many leaders and ministers already confirmed to participate in the SDG Action Weekend sessions.  We strongly encourage all interested Member States to reach out to the SDG Action Weekend organizers and we will accommodate as best we can.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are also happy to see that Member States will be organizing over 40 side events over the weekend.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is essential that this Summit delivers the breakthroughs, commitment, solidarity and fresh momentum the world needs to realize the promise of the 2030 Agenda.  Most important of all, however, we will leave with a to-do list for each and every country and partner and to which we must hold ourselves accountable.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can continue to count on the UN development system, especially our resident coordinators and country teams to work with your Governments and other key stakeholders at the country level to translate the momentum and commitments from next week into the progress we all want to see — for people and planet.\n",

      "\n",
      "The United Nations Charter is our roadmap to a more peaceful world.  The tools and mechanisms founded on the principles of the Charter are a how-to manual to resolve conflict.  Together, our collective efforts over the years have contributed to preventing war on a global scale and saving millions of lives through peacemaking and preventive diplomacy, UN peacekeeping operations, disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, humanitarian and development programmes, and activities to promote human rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just this week, the SDG Summit agreed on a rescue plan for the Sustainable Development Goals — an essential tool to prevent conflict and crises of all kinds.  Multilateralism works.  It is essential and effective.  But multilateral tools and mechanisms are weakening.  In the face of rising geopolitical tensions and challenges, some are failing while others — frameworks that are urgently needed — do not yet exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of conflict-related deaths last year almost doubled.  United Nations peace operations are under unprecedented strain.  Nuclear disarmament is at a virtual standstill.  And there are no adequate global frameworks to address the security threats posed by new technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "I urge Governments to go further and do better to recommit to their obligations under the United Nations Charter, to use the full range of diplomatic tools that it provides, to prioritize the prevention of conflict and crises and to consider the proposals for new frameworks and tools in the New Agenda for Peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in clear violation of the United Nations Charter and international law, is aggravating geopolitical tensions and divisions, threatening regional stability, increasing the nuclear threat, and creating deep fissures in our increasingly multipolar world.  All this comes at a time when cooperation and compromise for multilateral solutions are needed more than ever to tackle challenges from the climate crisis to unprecedented levels of inequality to disruptive technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Nations organs have been clear in condemning the war. The General Assembly overwhelmingly approved one resolution demanding that Russia leave Ukraine, and a second rejecting Russia’s efforts to annex Ukrainian territory.  I have consistently and repeatedly called for a just and sustainable peace in Ukraine, in line with the Charter and international law — for Ukraine, for Russia, and for the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia’s invasion was followed by relentless, systematic attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure and services, including health and education facilities.  The war has killed or injured tens of thousands of civilians, destroyed lives and livelihoods, traumatized a generation of children, torn families and communities apart, devastated the economy and turned vast areas of farmland into deadly minefields.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure must stop immediately.  Nearly half of Ukraine’s population — some 18 million people — need humanitarian assistance and protection.  More than 6 million Ukrainians have fled the country.  The United Nations has worked collectively to mitigate the impact on people, both in Ukraine and around the world and to support civilians. Our humanitarian programmes have stepped up, distributing aid to more than 8 million people this year in partnership with over 450 humanitarian organizations, half of them Ukrainian.\n",
      "\n",
      "The International Atomic Energy Agency has established a presence at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and other major Ukrainian nuclear sites, to monitor safety, security and safeguards.  Together with the International Committee of the Red Cross, we successfully organized the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evidence of shocking and widespread human rights violations has been documented by UN agencies, including conflict-related sexual violence, arbitrary detentions; summary executions — mostly by the Russian Federation — and the forcible transfer of Ukrainian civilians, including children, to territory under Russian control or to the Russian Federation. This documentation is vital for accountability.  Accountability for all human rights violations is crucial, in line with international norms and standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The war contributed to an unprecedented surge in global food prices, threatening millions with hunger and poverty.  Starting in July 2022, we succeeded in mitigating that impact through the Black Sea Initiative and the Memorandum of Understanding between the United Nations and the Russian Federation.\n",
      "\n",
      "During its one-year period of operation, the Black Sea Initiative, together with the Memorandum of Understanding on facilitating exports of Russian food products and fertilizers, helped to reduce global food prices by over 23 per cent from the record high reached in March last year. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Black Sea Initiative enabled the export of nearly 33 million metric tons of grain and foodstuffs and allowed the World Food Programme to transport 725,000 metric tons of wheat for humanitarian aid to countries including Afghanistan and Somalia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the Memorandum of Understanding, the United Nations delivered solutions on several of the most challenging areas of trade facilitation for Russian food and fertilizers, with continuous work on the remaining issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "We deeply regret that Russia ended its participation in the Black Sea Initiative in July of this year.  And that, immediately upon leaving, Russia launched a bombardment of Ukrainian ports and grain storage facilities on the Black Sea and the Danube River.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attacks against terminals and grain stores are unacceptable and such assaults must end.  Civilian shipping in the Black Sea has also been threatened.  Further escalation could instantly shock the markets and destabilize the region.  Volatility and uncertainty have already returned to international grain markets, while supplies from the harvest in Ukraine pile up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bombardment is also undermining our efforts in the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Russian Federation. It has led many of those whose goodwill is needed, notably in the private sector, to question whether there is any real interest in re-joining the Black Sea Initiative.\n",
      "\n",
      "We remain engaged with all parties, aiming to ensure safe and secure exports of grain and fertilizer from Russia and Ukraine. These must be put on a stable footing, without the repeated threat of interruption. I am grateful to the Government of Türkiye for its contributions and urge all Member States to support our efforts.\n",

      "In 2015, countries unanimously committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development — an action plan to advance a world of peace, prosperity and dignity for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, that promise is in peril.  Halfway to the 2030 deadline the world is woefully off-track.  The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Progress Report Special Edition paints a stark picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "It shows that progress on fully half of all SDG targets is weak and insufficient.  That almost a third have stalled or gone into reverse.  That emissions continue to rise.  Gaping inequalities persist.  Hunger is back to 2005 levels.  Gender equality is 300 years away.  And on our current course, almost 600 million people will still be mired in extreme poverty by 2030.  The COVID-19 pandemic, a burgeoning climate crisis, widespread conflict, and the consequences of the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine have hobbled fragile and limited progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, let’s be clear:  our world was off track well before these upheavals.  Ambition, urgency and solidarity have been lacking.  So has finance.  Many countries are facing a financial abyss.  The annual SDG funding gap has risen from $2.5 trillion before the pandemic to an estimated $4.2 trillion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Promises made on official development assistance and climate finance are not promises kept.  Governments are drowning in debt — with developing countries facing sky-high borrowing costs.  And 52 nations are in default or close to it — with no effective system of debt relief in sight.\n",

      "This is the high-level political forum.  The world is crying out for high-level political action.  Action to make the Sustainable Development Goals a reality — for everyone, everywhere.  Without it, the 2030 promise is in danger of slipping away:  Sowing disillusionment, mistrust and resentment, imperilling the planet, failing women and girls, and denying opportunity and hope for millions of people.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our dangerous and divided world, no country can afford such an outcome.  It is in all our interests to choose a different path.  The 2030 Agenda is that path.  It is a route to bridging divides, restoring trust and building solidarity.  I urge every country to make 2023 count.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lay the ground now for coordinated efforts to get the Sustainable Development Goals on track — by making the most of the Food Systems Summit Stocktaking, the Climate Ambition Summit, the three health meetings, the preparatory meeting for the Summit of the Future, the Group of 20 (G20), the Annual Meetings of the Bretton Woods Institutions, the twenty-eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), and of course, above all, the SDG Summit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, I urge every Government to come to the SDG Summit with clear plans and pledges to strengthen action in their countries to 2030.  We need ambitious national commitments and interventions to reduce poverty and inequality by 2027 and 2030.  And clear policies, investment plans and partnerships to drive progress across major SDG transitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also need the SDG Summit to re-energize civil society, businesses, and others to throw their weight behind the goals – strengthening the global movement to deliver.  I welcome the engagement and moral voice of young people and civil society here this week. And I urge you to continue to fight for the SDGs.  Above all, we need the SDG Summit to send a clear message from world leaders through a strong political declaration.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the negotiations are now in the final days, I urge each and every delegation to show flexibility and ambition so that together we rise to meet the moment.  We need a political declaration that renews and revitalizes the SDG promise;  That lays a path for faster progress on key SDG transitions, from social protection and jobs, to energy, education and more. And that sends a clear signal on finance:  by demanding urgent action to deliver the SDG Stimulus and by paving the way for much-needed reforms of the international financial architecture.  Why?  Because finance is the fuel that will drive SDG progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, today’s international financial system is failing: It is failing to provide developing countries with long-term, affordable finance for development and climate action. And it is failing to provide those countries with a safety net in the face of shocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have called for a new Bretton Woods moment.  And put forward a Policy Brief proposing how we can redesign the global financial architecture so that it operates as a global safety net for all countries and provides access to affordable long-term finance.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, we can and must act now to provide immediate relief to developing and emerging economies.  That is why I have proposed the SDG Stimulus of $500 billion per year for investments in sustainable development and climate action.  We need a massive surge in finance, including through increasing the capital base of multilateral development banks.  And through changing their business models so they leverage far more private finance at reasonable cost to developing countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SDG Stimulus also calls for action on debt — urging leaders to establish a timely and effective debt relief mechanism that supports payment suspensions, for countries facing severe shocks, longer lending terms and lower rates.  And it calls for an expansion of contingency financing for countries in need, including through rechannelling special drawing rights including through multilateral development banks — the multiplier effect.  This can all be achieved now — if there is sufficient political will.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need meaningful strides in the right direction by the end of 2023.  So, I am urging G20 countries to set a timeframe this year to establish a new debt resolution mechanism.  And developed countries to honour their commitments on climate finance:  Deliver the promised $100 billion this year, replenish the Green Climate Fund and double funding for adaptation.  This cannot wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every one of our SDG goals demands that we accelerate climate action.  The World Bank estimates that up to 130 million people could be pushed into poverty by 2030 because of rising temperatures.  Already, now, today:  wildfire smoke is choking people across North America; lack of food is taking lives in the Horn of Africa; floods and hurricanes are destroying homes and wrecking livelihoods around the world.  All this when temperatures have risen 1.1°C.  Yet, current policies are taking us to an increase of 2.8°C.  This is madness.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, it is not too late to change course.  Limiting the rise in global temperature to 1.5°C is possible if the world takes a quantum leap in climate action, together. To achieve this, I have proposed a Climate Solidarity Pact — in which big emitters make extra efforts to cut emissions and wealthier countries support emerging economies to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I have put forward an Acceleration Agenda to super-charge these efforts.  This asks countries to accelerate their net zero timelines, in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means developed countries committing to reach net zero as close as possible to 2040 and emerging economies as close as possible to 2050.  And it asks them to take concrete steps to phase out fossil fuels, to deliver climate justice, and to accelerate a just transition and a renewables revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must show that we are serious if we are to rebuild trust between nations.  By the end of COP28, I count on all G20 leaders to have committed to ambitious new nationally determined contributions.  And I urge all parties to ensure that COP28 operationalizes the loss-and-damage fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "We face a bleak picture with challenges at every turn.  But, as we cross the halfway mark to 2030, one overriding truth stands out in my mind:  Change is possible.  Backsliding is not inevitable.  Poverty, pollution and gender inequality are not pre-ordained.  They are trends that can be reversed, problems that can be solved, tragedies that can be averted, lives that can be saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "And together, we can deliver.  Let’s make this year count.  Let’s keep the promise.\n",

      "Content: Following is the text of UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ video message at the Opening of the Economic and Social Council Humanitarian Affairs Segment, in Geneva today: \n",
      "\n",
      "Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,\n",
      "\n",
      "I am pleased to send my greetings to this year’s Economic and Social Council Humanitarian Affairs Segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global humanitarian needs this year are at record levels — once again.  360 million people worldwide need humanitarian assistance — up 30 per cent since the start of last year.  More than 110 million people have been forced from their homes.  And more than 260 million people face acute food insecurity, with some at risk of famine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reasons have not changed:  unresolved conflicts grind on while new wars are launched – with a devastating impact on civilians; global economic woes, started by COVID-19 and aggravated by the worldwide impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, are hitting the most vulnerable hardest; sustainable development — the ultimate prevention tool — has stagnated or gone into reverse; and the climate crisis has contributed to the deaths of thousands of people and displaced millions over the past year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordinary people are paying an unacceptable price, as parties to conflict violate international law, attack hospitals, schools and critical infrastructure, and commit rampant human rights violations, including gender-based violence against women and girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,\n",
      "\n",
      "Humanitarian aid agencies and our partners on the ground are finding new ways to provide emergency aid around the world.  In response to growing humanitarian needs, they are reaching more people and delivering more aid, and making every dollar go as far as possible.  Over recent years, humanitarian aid has helped to avert famine in Somalia, Afghanistan and across the Sahel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, aid workers ramped up deliveries to support some 15.4 million people in Ukraine.  Since the start of this year, humanitarians have reached 17 million people in Afghanistan, 2.8 million in Nigeria and 2.5 million in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  These are huge aid operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The humanitarian community has come together to mobilize financial resources, advocate for civilians caught up in conflict, anticipate crises and meet needs in underfunded emergencies.  Humanitarian workers have achieved this despite growing insecurity and attacks on themselves and their supplies.  I salute their efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,\n",
      "\n",
      "We know what needs to be done.  But, we lack the funds to do it.  Chronic underfunding and record levels of humanitarian need are stretching the system to the breaking point.  Halfway through 2023, we have received just 20 per cent of funds needed under the Global Humanitarian Appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is causing a crisis within a crisis.  United Nations agencies have already been forced to reduce food aid in Syria, Bangladesh, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Afghanistan and Yemen.  Without a solution to the funding crisis, further cuts are inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "This week is an important opportunity to discuss a range of issues, including how to increase humanitarian resources; how we can deliver more efficient and effective humanitarian aid; how we can better protect individuals in crises, particularly women and girls; how we can reduce food insecurity by supporting sustainable development and addressing the root causes of conflict; and how we can increase resilience by investing in climate adaptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,\n",
      "\n",
      "The global humanitarian crisis is damning evidence of our collective failure to address the gravest problems of our time.  As we work to strengthen the humanitarian system, we must also double down on efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts, recommit to international law, address the climate crisis and ease human suffering. Thank you.\n",

      "\n",
      "Halfway through the timeline of the 2030 Agenda, we are leaving more than half the world behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poverty and hunger are again growing.  The climate crisis is escalating.  Conflict and persecution have forced 100 million people from their homes.  And the economic destruction and dislocation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic was prolonged and amplified by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cost of food, energy and finance has risen sharply, with a devastating impact on vulnerable countries and communities.  Inequalities and gender discrimination are on the rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — our only comprehensive solution to these crises — are far off track.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have gone into reverse on more than 30 per cent of SDG targets — including our most fundamental goals of reducing poverty and hunger.  Progress on another 50 per cent is weak and insufficient.  But it is not too late to turn the tide.  And we are determined to do just that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SDG Stimulus, the proposed reforms of the global financial architecture, the Acceleration Agenda on climate, the Transforming Education Summit, Food Systems transformation, the Global Digital Compact, the Global Accelerator on Social Protection and Jobs, the Black Sea Grain Initiative and the memorandum of understanding on promoting Russian food and fertilizers to global markets – all these initiatives are aimed at reducing poverty, inequality and hunger, and getting the 2030 Agenda back on course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the world, United Nations country teams lead our efforts for sustainable, inclusive development.  They are our eyes, ears and hands, supporting Governments, convening stakeholders, and striving to translate global and regional commitments on the SDGs into action.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we started the reform process, no one foresaw that our country teams would be operating in such challenging conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite that, four years on, the reforms have succeeded.  My report on the quadrennial comprehensive policy review implementation demonstrates that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The verdict is in:  resident coordinators are bringing United Nations entities together in support of countries’ priorities for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are also working together to help address crises that cross borders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overwhelming majority of host Governments agree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fully 88 per cent say that resident coordinators provide effective and strategic leadership in support of their national plans and priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "All least developed countries and landlocked developing countries surveyed said the United Nations activities were closely aligned with their needs and priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "And all small island developing States said collaboration between UN entities has improved since the reforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system is data-driven — which is delivering new levels of transparency and accountability.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Egypt, the reinvigorated role of the resident coordinator was a catalyst to mobilize United Nations expertise and comprehensive action to support the Egyptian Presidency of the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties on the climate crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Pakistan, the newly empowered resident coordinator system coordinated across the entire United Nations family with the Government, in response to the devastating floods that affected 33 million people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cooperation Framework was the blueprint for a long-term approach to support recovery, going beyond the immediate humanitarian response to involve international financial institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In small island developing States, the integrated support provided by our multi-country offices is helping to address issues ranging from climate adaptation to debt distress.\n",
      "\n",
      "The transformative vision of the 2030 Agenda relies on a global partnership and unprecedented investment.  But that investment has not been forthcoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many developing countries simply cannot afford to invest in the SDGs because they face a financing abyss.  The annual SDG funding gap stood at $2.5 trillion before the COVID-19 pandemic.  According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), it now stands at some 4.2 trillion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developed countries adopted expansionary fiscal and monetary policies and have now largely returned to their pre-pandemic trajectory of economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Developing countries have been hobbled by their inability to do the same.  Vulnerable middle-income countries are denied debt relief and concessional financing; and the Common Framework for Debt Treatment is not yet effectively working.  If they go to the markets, developing countries may be charged interest rates up to eight times higher than their developed counterparts.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is clear that something is seriously wrong with the rules and governance structures that produce these results.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have therefore called for an SDG Stimulus — an emergency measure to scale up affordable long-term financing for all countries in need, by at least $500 billion a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, we are working on long-term proposals to right the fundamental injustices and inequalities in global financial architecture which reflect the global realities of 78 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "I count on your support for these proposals, and for all our efforts to accelerate the 2030 Agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, we rely on our partnerships with the Governments of developing countries to get the most out of every development dollar.  And to do that, we need adequate, predictable and flexible funding for the United Nations development system.\n",
      "\n",
      "I thank those Members that have maintained or increased their financial support to the United Nations development system.  However, the resident coordinator system is still chronically underfunded.  We are far from reaching the targets we committed to four years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resident coordinator system is the anchor for all our efforts to support countries in achieving the 2030 Agenda.  Yet, in 2022, the resident coordinator system suffered from a funding gap of $85 million.  The Joint SDG Fund is far short of the Funding Compact target of $290 million per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless Member States step up, we are effectively starving the United Nations development system of the support it needs to deliver for Member States.\n",
      "\n",
      "A recruitment freeze is reducing our ability to deliver.  With every month that passes, further reductions will have to be made, affecting our ability to coordinate the United Nations system and convene beyond it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have responded to the concerns of Member States.  We are now turning to Member States to meet their commitments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us recall we are talking about $85 million — a tiny investment for the returns we are already witnessing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Development coordination saves lives by eradicating poverty and preventing humanitarian crises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Countries are spending more than $2 trillion a year on military budgets.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is simply not credible to pledge support for peace, if they are not prepared to invest a tiny fraction of this amount in sustainable development — the greatest conflict prevention tool we have.\n",
      "\n",
      "I therefore urge Member States to reconsider my recommendation for a hybrid 2.0 funding model for the United Nations development system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current funding model for the resident coordinator system is far too vulnerable to fluctuations in voluntary funding, making it unpredictable and unsustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has also failed to provide sufficient resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most logical, principled solution is to fund the resident coordinator system with a greater share of assessed contributions under the regular budget of the United Nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, in the coming months, I intend to launch a transparent, inclusive consultation process with Member States so that all views are heard before a formal proposal is submitted to the General Assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ask you to approach these consultations with a sense of urgency, solidarity and resolve.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must address this unfinished business from the reforms as we head towards the SDG summit in September.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creative new approaches have not worked.  A new funding model, with a greater share of assessed contributions through the regular budget, is the only sustainable, predictable, and realistic option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, the United Nations and countries around the world are working towards a generational shift in global development — a shift towards fairness and justice in development financing, and a dynamic in-country support system that is aligned with the needs and priorities of Member States.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SDG Summit in September must be a moment of unity to provide a renewed impetus and accelerated action for achieving the SDGs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It must deliver concrete progress on the means of implementation and a clear commitment to overhaul the current international financial architecture.\n",

      "Content: Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, at the informal briefing for Member States ahead of the Economic and Social Council Segment on Operational Activities for Development, today:\n",
      "\n",
      "I am grateful, Mr. Vice-President, for the opportunity to engage informally with Member States on the upcoming Operational Activities Segment of the Economic and Social Council.  We also thank you for your leadership efforts to ensure a successful Segment — your personal engagement in its preparations and the ambition you are imprinting are an inspiration to myself and my team.  The Secretary-General and I are looking forward to the Segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the heavy burden of work, we hope delegations have had an opportunity to go through the reports we have shared ahead of the Segment:  The Secretary-General’s report on the implementation of the QCPR [quadrennial comprehensive policy review]; and my report — as Chair of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group — on the Development Coordination Office and Resident Coordinator System.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we approach the Segment, we must take a step back and look at the context in which we meet.  These are no ordinary times.  The world is at an inflection point.  Challenges are mounting every day.  Poverty and hunger are at an all-time high. Climate emergencies are knocking on all our doors.  Conflicts and humanitarian needs are rising at a faster scale than anything we have seen before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, we know what the solution is:  sustainable, inclusive development.  It is the only way to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities. To address mistrust and vulnerabilities. To prevent conflict and crises.  Yet, we are far from achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and sustainable development remains chronically under-funded.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is, however, not too late to change course.  The SDG Summit later this year provides a unique opportunity to pivot.  We now have a clear picture of what is needed to get there.  Moving from Goal-by-Goal efforts to focusing on key transitions will allow countries to accelerate — climate action, energy, food, education, jobs and social protection and digital connectivity.  This approach underscores the importance of an integrated agenda for sustainable development.  And by paying much more attention to means of implementation, these will be the pathways to success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The repositioned United Nations system, now fit for purpose, is delivering results.  In launching these reforms, the Secretary-General knew that achieving the SDGs would require a very different United Nations development system.  And that is also why he has worked hand-in-hand with Member States to reposition development at the heart of the United Nations. He anticipated that the ability of the United Nations development system to translate global commitments on the ground would be more essential than ever.  The system is also transforming, at an increasingly rapid pace, to respond with the skillsets and at the scale required to help implement the SDGs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reports you have in front of you are a testament to that. Multiple data sources and independent evaluations have come repeatedly to the same conclusion:  Under the leadership of Resident Coordinators, United Nations country teams are delivering better support to countries’ needs and priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to mention a few:  94 per cent of host Governments agreed that the United Nations Country Team activities adequately reflected the content of the Cooperation Framework (and therefore national priorities).  Almost 80 per cent agreed that United Nations country teams were more focused on common results than before the reforms.  Eighty-eight per cent have reported that Resident Coordinators provide effective and strategic leadership in support of national plans and priorities.  Eighty-seven per cent agree that Resident Coordinators are now a more effective entry point to United Nations country support.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Secretary-General and I were particularly humbled by the fact that countries in special situations reported very favourably on the progress made thanks to the reform process.  All least developed countries and landlocked developing countries surveyed considered that United Nations activities were closely aligned with their needs and priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "All small island developing States agreed that United Nations entities were working more collaboratively than before the reforms — clearly the strengthening of multi-country offices has been key.  And it was the input and the alignment of the Member States that ensured that we got the ambitions of those expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To give a sense of progress:  In 2019, when we transitioned to a new system, 70 per cent of the small island developing States were satisfied with the alignment of United Nations system support.  This proportion has improved to 84 per cent in 2021 and to 95 per cent in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "We hope the upcoming Economic and Social Council Segment will provide you with ample opportunities to see tangible and compelling results achieved by our principals in the United Nations Sustainable Development Group and country teams around the globe.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see many developments that give us hope.  At the country level, the United Nations development system is sharpening its ability to offer integrated policy advice and connect expertise across the system — including non-resident agencies — for specific country needs and priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have come a long way — from resolutions; to the implementation of the mechanics of the reforms (the Management and Accountability Frameworks, dual lines); to the emergence of a new generation of United Nations country teams.  Increasingly, Resident Coordinators are becoming the centre of gravity of our ability to convene partners, to help countries mobilize the necessary means of implementation — including financing for the SDGs.  Ninety-seven per cent of host Governments agreed that United Nations country teams engage meaningfully with international financial institutions, an increase from 90 per cent in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another exciting trend is that the United Nations development system is visibly coalescing around the key transitions need for the SDGs. 117 countries have developed national pathways to sustainable food systems, as a follow-up to the 2021 Food System Summit.  Energy Compacts grew from $400 billion to $600 billion to finance clean energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Nations country teams and Resident Coordinators provided crucial support ahead of the 2022 Transforming Education Summit and pursue their work with countries as they shape their response.  Sustainable pipelines are also being developed, enabling investments to flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the regional level, Regional Collaborative Platforms have gathered traction as a means to support United Nations country teams in delivering an integrated response and addressing cross-border development issues.  Between February and April, as Chair of the five Regional Collaborative Platforms, I engaged with all United Nations regional directors across regions to continue to emphasize the importance of deploying our regional assets to better respond to country-level needs and strengthen vertical integration and alignments in key areas.  This year will be a litmus test for the regional architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the global level, our United Nations Sustainable Development Group has stepped up to treat development as an emergency — as we advanced the Secretary-General’s proposals to revamp the international financing architecture; or as we responded, through the Secretary-Generals Global Crises Response Group, to the food and energy crisis resulting from the conflict in Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "We continued to make strides in efficiencies.  In 2022, United Nations entities generated $405 million in efficiency gains — an increase of 47 per cent from 2021.  This is a landmark in our repositioning journey. We are also delivering on our commitment to strengthen transparency and accountability.  For the first time, results achieved in 2022 through the RC system are also reported through the revised multi-annual Resident Coordinator system results framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early this year, I shared with the governing bodies a reform checklist as an oversight tool to help ensure a harmonized approach across all United Nations development system entities and adherence to the reforms.  I encourage governing bodies and Heads of Entities to make full use of the checklist and to provide regular updates at the Operational Activities Segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am aware some of you may be concerned whether the reports are showing an overly “rosy” picture.  My response is that, overall, they are — because the progress is real.  In these reports, we let the data speak.  We encourage each and every one of you to also forge your own assessment — consult your capitals or embassies who work closer to the collaboration at the country level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our goal is to have access to as much data and feedback as feasible.  It helps us adjust, improve and maximize the impacts of the reforms to your expectations. But our reports are also very clear on the areas where performance is below expectation, which require more attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many issues remain, as we should expect in any large-scale reform process — from uneven behavioural change across the system, through a mixed picture in the derivation of Cooperation Frameworks into country programmes of United Nations entities, to insufficient progress in the Funding Compact.  You can count on the Secretary-General and me to continue to work with United Nations Principals — relentlessly — to address all issues as they surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "We count on your leadership to identify opportunities in intergovernmental processes or beyond that can continue to send the right incentives to accelerate our transformation even further.\n",
      "\n",
      "Funding remains a make-or-break.  Member States and United Nations entities have made progress towards achieving important commitments in the Funding Compact.  But progress has been mixed and unable to reach the demands. For the first time, core funding exceeded the target of 30 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking closer, the increase is largely linked to specific investments — for example in the World Health Organization (WHO) during the pandemic. Meanwhile, while overall pooled funding has increased and even surpassed our target of 10 per cent.  Concerningly, the Joint SDG Fund — our flagship instrument for SDG transformation — falls well short of the Funding Compact target of $290 million per year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite significant efforts by the Secretary-General, entities across the United Nations system and many Member States — who went above and beyond — the Resident Coordinator System remains chronically under-funded. In 2022, the funding gap of voluntary contributions was $85 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all know this is not viable.  It jeopardizes hard-won gains and our ability to help countries in this critical mid-point of the SDGs, seven years before the 2030 deadline.  The report highlights key areas where the Development Coordination Office had to begin scaling back in 2022 with implications for our activities.  Continuing into 2023, a persisting funding gap would increasingly affect our ability to deliver on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The time has come for a definite solution.  If we agree that achieving the 2030 Agenda matters and that development coordination is essential, then we must respond with resolve.  All indicators show that the reforms are working.  Many thought we would fail.  But working in partnership, we have succeeded.  The new Resident Coordinator system is a reality and it is delivering on its promises. De-investing at this point in time would be a disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he announced in his report, the Secretary-General intends to request the General Assembly in a dedicated report, in the second half of the year, to re-consider the option for a hybrid 2.0 funding model for the Resident Coordinator system.  The exact format and timing of this report will depend on the transparent and inclusive consultations that we will hold with Member States and reactions by the Economic and Social Council in the upcoming Segment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know some of you had expected “more creativity” in the funding model.  But we need to be fair.  The Resident Coordinator system funding model is already the most “creative” across all entities of the United Nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "We now rely on complex and highly innovative funding components, and we remain vulnerable to fluctuations in voluntary funding.  This is a core function for development.  It is the foundation on which all the rest relies on billions of investments in development entities to deliver coherently on the SDGs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reinvigorated Resident Coordinator system allows for a minimum core capacity, universally, to address basic coordination needs to enable wider United Nations country team action at greater scale to help countries implement the SDGs.  Yet, it is flexible enough to ensure each Resident Coordinator Office is able to adapt to specific country issues via other sources (agency secondees; humanitarian staffers via the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs; peace advisors, inter alia).\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no one size fits all.  We hope we can hear your insights and reactions we head to the Economic and Social Council Segment.  We have only one ask.  Please protect the same sense of partnership and ambition that has fuelled these reforms from day one.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see many experts in this room.  I know how hard your job can be.  Balancing capital considerations and big-picture geopolitical issues with the realities of these basements.  It is only with your leadership, experience and support that we can move ahead. \n",
      "\n",
      "While complex, the process ahead is also full of opportunities, and we trust we can count on constructive and active engagement by all. My team and I will always have our doors open for you to bring the latest feedback from the field to inform your decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the current situation requires a sense of urgency — we can no longer afford to move from review to review without a solution.  It is time for an agreement — ultimately, we will live, albeit on life support, with whatever decision you make, in your collective wisdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us look ahead.  Towards 2030 and the world we want.  The Secretary-General and I stand ready to work with you to offer the best possible support to countries.  Together, we can achieve the 2030 Agenda.  This is what is at stake.  Let us bear it in mind.\n",

      "Header: ‘No Time to Lose’ for Closing Finance Divide, as Multifaceted Crisis Devastates World’s Poorest Countries, Secretary-General Tells Economic and Social Council Forum\n",
      "Content: Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the 2023 Economic and Social Council Forum on Financing for Development Follow-up, in New York today:\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I deliver my opening statement, I would like to say a few words about what’s going on in Sudan.\n",
      "\n",
      "I strongly condemn the outbreak of fighting that is taking place in Sudan, and appeal to the leaders of the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces to immediately cease hostilities, restore calm and begin a dialogue to resolve the crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation has already led to horrendous loss of life, including many civilians.  Any further escalation could be devastating for the country and the region.  I urge all those with influence over the situation to use it in the cause of peace; to support efforts to end the violence, restore order and return to the path of transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The humanitarian situation in Sudan was already precarious and is now catastrophic.  I condemn the deaths and injuries to civilians and humanitarian workers and the targeting and looting of premises. I remind all parties of the need to respect international law, including ensuring the safety and security of all United Nations and associated personnel and humanitarian aid workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have spoken during the weekend with the two Sudanese leaders and I am actively engaging with the African Union, the Arab League and leaders across the region.  I reaffirm that the United Nations stands with the people of Sudan at this very difficult time, with full support for their efforts to restore the democratic transition and build a peaceful, secure future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I will deliver my statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The world is in crisis — a multidimensional crisis that is turbocharging inequalities, with a devastating impact on the poorest and most vulnerable.  The 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals are turning into a mirage of what might have been, as communities and Governments struggle to meet immediate needs.  The scars of the COVID-19 pandemic run deep in developing countries that suffered terrible losses in lives and livelihoods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The war in Ukraine is contributing to a global cost of living crisis.  Climate disasters are becoming more frequent, deadly and expensive.  One in three countries is at high risk of a fiscal crisis. And more than 40 per cent of people in extreme poverty live in countries afflicted by severe debt problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "These trends are deeply damaging to the poorest people and communities — but not to the richest.  One recent report on inequality found that, since the pandemic, the richest 1 per cent of people around the world have captured nearly twice as much new wealth as the rest of the world combined.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inequalities within some countries are regressing towards early twentieth century levels — to a time before women were allowed to vote and before widespread acceptance of the concept of social protection.  This shames us all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2023 Financing for Sustainable Development Report reveals a yawning finance divide that will quickly turn into a development deficit for many countries — and a crisis in global trust and solidarity.  Inequality is already leading to social unrest at the local and national level, and rising tensions and risks at the global level.  Delay will only make these problems worse, as the climate crisis gathers pace and inequalities continue to grow.  We have no time to lose.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the background to my proposal to Group of 20 (G20) countries for an Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Stimulus to scale up affordable long-term financing for all countries in need, by at least $500 billion a year.  The SDG Stimulus has three main areas for action.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, it aims to boost liquidity for investments in the transformations we need to achieve the SDGs:  renewable energy, sustainable food systems, and the fourth industrial revolution. All sources of financing must be scaled up, and multilateral development banks have an important role to play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multilateral development banks should be able to transform their business models and accept a new approach to risk.  This includes massively leveraging their funds to attract greater flows of private finance into developing countries at reasonable costs. As their shareholders, I urge you to do everything in your power to increase their capital bases, support a more efficient use of their balance sheets, and bring about better lending terms to substantially increase their investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must also broaden eligibility criteria for concessional finance so that it is available to vulnerable middle-income countries in need, as well as the least developed economies.  Rich countries should meet their official development assistance (ODA) commitments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the SDG Stimulus aims to tackle the high cost of debt and rising risks of debt distress.  I have called for an ambitious debt relief initiative that enables countries in distress to exchange short-term debt for longer-term instruments at lower interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also need mechanisms to incentivize private creditors to participate alongside official creditors in debt restructurings.  We need to move innovative ideas — like debt-for-SDG swaps and disaster clauses that suspend payments in times of crisis — from the drawing board to the boardroom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Nations, as the only organization with universal membership, is ready to facilitate inclusive dialogue on sovereign debt, bringing together the discussions that are happening in different forums.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, contingency financing must be expanded.  Last year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) allocated $650 billion in Special Drawing Rights — the main global mechanism to boost liquidity during crises.  Based on current quotas, developed countries received 26 times more than least developed countries, and 13 times more than all the countries of Africa combined.  Something is fundamentally wrong with the rules and governance system that produced this outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Special Drawing Rights should be channelled to countries that need them, including through multilateral development banks. The African Development Bank’s proposal is a welcome step.  I also call for a [Special Drawing Rights] contingency mechanism to ensure that in future crises, they are issued promptly and automatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SDG Stimulus can make an immediate difference to developing countries and the trajectory of the 2030 Agenda, and I count on your strong support.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the longer term, we will not solve today’s challenges by relying on the financial system that helped to cause them.  The global financial architecture was created for a world that no longer exists.  It cannot address the challenges faced today by developing countries.  Let’s be honest:  it has failed countries at their moment of greatest need.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is now widely recognized that we need an economic system that is coherent and coordinated, and reflects today’s global economic reality. A system that supports stable economic conditions; and helps countries to invest in the SDGs.  Groups including the G20, the G7 and the Bridgetown Initiative are discussing reforms.  As custodian of the SDGs and Paris Agreement, the United Nations brings together diverse views and expertise across all dimensions of sustainable development and financing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Economic and Social Council Forum on Financing for Development and the high-level political forum are important platforms to chart a new course.  They must pave the way for the decisions to be taken at the SDG Summit in September, and the Summit of the Future next year.  I urge all countries to play their part at this crucial moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need engagement and support from all corners of the world to renew the international financial architecture and make it able to face the challenges of today and tomorrow.\n",

The package includes three pieces of legislation: a stronger role for the European Medicines Agency, extending the mandate of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and a proposal for a regulation on serious cross-border threats to health.\n",

      "COVI Chair Kathleen Van Brempt (S&D, BE) said: “Our Committee has undertaken a thorough assessment of the course of the pandemic and its impact on the EU. It became clear that Europe not only needs the tools to develop long-term policies, with clear goals and roadmaps. It must also be ready to act quickly, efficiently and in the interests of every European. The EU must also thoroughly evaluate its role in the global response to the pandemic and commit more than ever to international cooperation and solidarity, especially with partners in the Global South. It is now up to the European Commission to take our recommendations and table proposals to shape a more crisis-resilient and future-proof EU.”\n",

The EU’s response to the pandemic was exemplary in securing vaccines, NextGenerationEU funds, and preparing for future health emergencies. We must strengthen the EU further to protect our health workers, to make sure we do not neglect any disease, and to help the most vulnerable in society. We must boost research, fight against fake news and cyber attacks, and create a competitive pharmaceutical sector that enhances the EU's strategic autonomy in health.”\n",

The committee evaluated not only the impact on health systems and the vaccination campaign, but also the broader socio-economic impact, the impact on the rule of law and democracy, and the international response to the pandemic. It organised a thorough consultation process through a series of public hearings, workshops and on-site missions, exchanging views with experts, policymakers from EU institutions and international organisations, epidemiologists, health ministers, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare workers and researchers.\n",
